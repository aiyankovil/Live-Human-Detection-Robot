# Live-Human-Detection-Robot

A live human detection robot that autonomously scans an area for the presence of any live humans. The robot can be used to aid rescue workers during search and rescue operations.  <br/>
The bot is a four wheeled bot with onboard sensors and camera.The sensors are attached to augment the camera inputs for decision making. The bot may operate autonomously ie. scanning an area (like a room) for possible humans and alerting the operator in case of a match. In manual mode the operator takes over all functions of the bot, the operator can drive,tilt cameras and monitor sensor readings all from the app on his smartphone.</br>
