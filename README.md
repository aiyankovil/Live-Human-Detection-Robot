# Live-Human-Detection-Robot

A live human detection robot that autonomously scans an area for the presence of any live humans. The robot can be used to aid rescue worker humans during search and rescue operations.

<br/>
The robot is a four wheeled bot with onboard sensors and camera.The sensors are attached to augment the camera inputs for decision making. The bot may operate autonomously ie. scanning an area (like a room) for possible humans and alerting the operator in case of a match. In manual mode the operator takes over all functions of the bot, the operator can drive,tilt cameras and monitor sensor readings all from the app on his smartphone.</br>


<h3>Want to build your own LHDR?</h3>

We believe in open source and our entire source code can be found here, we have also tried to incorporate hardware details as much as possible. We would love to see you build a better LHDR or improve upon our project.

<h3>I can do better.</h3>

We realise that there are geniuses out there who can improve this project and find other uses to it in ways that we have not imagined. Clone this repo and do your magic, if you think we need to include your change in this repo send a pull request.
