The robot is a four wheeled bot with onboard sensors and camera.The sensors are attached to augment the camera inputs for decision making.</br>

The non-contact temperature sensors fixed to the bot gives a reading of the ambient temperture of the surroundings the sensor is pointed at.Attaching this sensor to a rotating arm gives us the ability to scan a whole room.(the method is time consuming but more cost efficent than acquiring a professional grade thermal scanner).

The sensor will provide us with temperature readings giving us a rough plane of possible matches, the camera is then focused to this place and employs image processing algorithms to confirm it is indeed a human. The whole process may happen autonomously or can be manually controlled. 

Manual control : in this case the operator can manually drive the robot using a phone or a tablet, and the combined camera and sensor reading will be displayed on screen. In the autonomous mode the robot scans the room using pre-programmed algorithms and alerts the operator in case of a positive id (or maybe asks the operator to confirm a positive ID).
