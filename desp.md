The robot is a four wheeled bot with onboard sensors and camera.
The basic idea is to use the sensors to augment the camera that uses
image processing.

The project is still under development.
If there is anything you'd like to know then post here.

_Update_

The robot is to be fitted with non-contact temperature sensors that gives a reading of the ambient temperture of the surroundings the sensor is pointed at. So we can attach this sensor to a rotating arm and scan a whole room or any given range (the method is time consuming but cost efficent than acquiring a professional grade thermal scanner).

The sensor will provide us with temperature readings giving us a rough plane of possible matches, the camera is then focused to this place and employs image processing algorithms to determine the shape and other aspects that help it confirm it is indeed a human. The whole process may happen autonomously or can be manually controlled.
