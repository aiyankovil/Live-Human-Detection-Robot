{"name":"Live-human-detection-robot","tagline":"A robot to detect live humans","body":"### About the Project\r\nThe LHDR aims to aid search and rescue operations by detecting the presence of a live human without the need of any human assistance. On detection it alerts the operator, this involves less risk for humans.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWeâ€™ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIf you are interested in the project or want to improve on it, send me a pull request in github.\r\nThe project is maintained by <a href=\"stanly-johnson.github.io\">Stanly Johnson</a> and <a href=\"stanly-johnson.github.io\">Jinu Geo James.</a>\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
